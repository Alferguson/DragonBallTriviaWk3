# DragonBallTriviaWk3

This is a trivia game based on the original DragonBall series. The user has 30 seconds to answer each question. The answers are listed below each question and on click, will record the user's answer. Over the course of the game, the game tracks how many the user got correct and how many the user got wrong (either if they picked the wrong answer or didn't pick the right answer in time). After each answer is clicked, either a reward gif or a loser gif will show. Then, a prompt will allow the user to go to the next question. At the end of the Trivia, the user's right questions and wrong questions is listed and a restart button is shown to start over.
